Notes:

Making some notes as I work through the koans in case I decide to contribute back

- SpecRunner doesn't tell you whats going wrong if you load it as static html
- Specrunner says "/koans" but code is in "/js/koans

Events
- bind is now on, following jqueries example
- line 72 obj.bind('an_event', changeColor, -->this<-- would be a nice clue);

Models
- expectedText - wrong way around
- Could use a hint on how to add feces to naughty_words list
- Needs more koans

Collection
- Shows 4 completed items from the start
- Needs more koans

Views
- expected - wrong way around
- change '#todoList' '#todo-list'
